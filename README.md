# html.resume
My first html resume
I am not sure if I should include this with "My first html portfolio" which is in my previous (and first ever) repository.
This is all my html knowledge in one html-only website. Now I'll learn css.
Not sure what exactly repositories are either.
But I'm doing what I can.
Good day.
